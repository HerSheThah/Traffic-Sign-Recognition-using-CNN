# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using-CNN
Traffic Sign recognition using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) under challenging environment

Developed a real-time Traffic Sign Recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for enhanced road safety and autonomous driving applications.

ðŸ”¹ Achieved 93.80% accuracy on the GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) dataset with 43 traffic sign categories.
ðŸ”¹ Replaced traditional ANN with CNN for improved performance and reduced overfitting.
ðŸ”¹ Utilized ELU activation instead of ReLU for better convergence during training.
ðŸ”¹ Built an interactive GUI using Tkinter, allowing users to upload images and recognize traffic signs instantly.
ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
ðŸ”¹ Training time: 1 hour | Achieved validation accuracy of 94.89%
